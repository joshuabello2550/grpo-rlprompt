# RLPrompt with GRPO and Soft Q-Learning

This repository contains the code and experiments for my final project for 6.7920 (Reinforcement Learning: Foundations and Methods) during Fall 2025.
The work extends RLPrompt (Deng et al., 2022) by comparing two reinforcement-learning–based prompt optimization algorithms—Soft Q-Learning and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)—under multiple reward types and evaluating their performance on BoolQ and GSM8K.
